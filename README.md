# My First Website: Learning Web Development Basics

## Overview
Welcome to my first website project! This endeavor is a testament to my journey in learning the essentials of web development. Through this website, I aim to showcase my newfound skills in HTML and CSS, emphasizing page structure, styling techniques (<bold> including the Box Model, Grid, and Flexbox </bold>), <bold> responsiveness </bold> across various devices, and the principles of writing clean and <bold> efficient </bold> code.

## News Site

I created a news site which is responsive. The number of columns differs regarding the size of the device. The site's design is inspired by traditional and modern news sites. It has such elements like: header, a main news article and a grid of news articles, navbar and footer.

## The problem

Layout's sketch was made in Figma. During the development of the project, the final outcome changed the form and is slightly different from the sketch - this is because of testing the website's utility. 
Website was built first for the mobile usage, and later on for tablet and desktop. This helped with making the web fully responsive.
